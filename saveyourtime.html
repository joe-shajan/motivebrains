               <p>Being busy is a form of laziness – lazy thinking and indiscriminate action. Eliminate the useless activities and find time for productive works. You know the only thing everybody in this world has in common no matter how much money fame or luxury they have, time. Same 24 hours in a day and although this might not come as a surprise to you it’s worthwhile that behind every success there a human being doing his or her best day after day. Dedication is often meaningless work in disguise. People are the wild care in life bossiness that can change the rules of the game at any point at the thing that makes all the difference is how they choose to spend their time.
                Utilize your time well and time will treat you well leading you into an overall sense of well-being. Don’t wait for a new year to make a change. Invest in your passion, invest in finding and discovering your purpose, invest in pursuing and cultivating, and invest your money and time for good returns and for some reasons. Refresh your page of your life and live well. Because at the end of the day remember we all are just stories.

            <h3 class="mt-2 mb-4 text-default">1. Set goals </h3> 
<p>Make arrangements, get the opportunity to work, stick to it, and reach goal. Defining your objectives is urgent for arranging your day. By defining your objectives you can make legitimate objective and you won't fall off timetable, before choosing your destinations you need to glimpse profoundly inside and inquire as to whether you need to accomplish those things, realizing your desire can assist you with expanding your profitability, help you to see the master plan and help you to do whatever number things as could be allowed in your 24 hour.
</p>

<h3 class="mt-2 mb-4 text-default">2. Prioritize your task</h3>
<p>Sometimes you can't do everything or you need more an ideal opportunity to do it that is the reason it's critical to fix your needs. A powerful method to do this is to deal with your needs by partitioning them into the following classes important and urgent, undertakings that should be done well away significant yet not critical, tasks that appear important you can decide when did do them but not before the first category. urgent but not important tasks that need to be done as soon as possible but when completed that don’t have any lasting value and not important not urgent these tasks are usually leisure activities or things you don’t really need to do you only want to do, improving perspective one your assignments and which ones should be managed first.
</p>

<h3 class="mt-2 mb-4 text-default">3. Delegate your work</h3>
<p>Your goal is to do more and less time right because you can’t expand time or get more hours in a day you can achieve this by either getting more efficient in how you use your time you already have and well cover this in details later on or delegate. Delegating means letting someone else take the lead on your responsibilities and trusting the outcome is the desired one. depending on the type of responsibilities yore dealing with you can delegate small tasks like hiring someone to schedule your time during the day or pick up your suit from cleaning or you can go even bigger and delegate work related tasks this requires a bit of a setup on your side and investing time and finding the right person you can trust but long term it’s worth it and the way.
</p>
<h3 class="mt-2 mb-4 text-default">4. Set Clear Deadlines</h3>
<p>Set clear deadlines, how much time do you have to finish your assignment, when do you need to complete your tasks. If you don’t know these things it might be hard for you to keep track of your time. It’s easier to be on time and do everything when it should be done if you set clear deadlines for each and every chore. If you choose your time limit on each task it will be easier for you to complete it and keep track of them and also on your time you can mark your deadlines in your list of assignments in your organizer or on your calendar. A calendar can be really useful and important if you’re to manage your time better.
</p>
<h3 class="mt-2 mb-4 text-default">5. Learn how to say NO
</h3>
<p>This concept refers to say no to a few things like distractions procrastination multitasking but most importantly it refers to saying no to tasks that may appear suddenly and are not necessarily your job. Don’t take on and new assignment if you’re not sure that you can handle them or that if you don’t have enough time to finish the ones that you already have and new ones too. Just learn to say a firm no or least delays those projects for a later period but pay attention to your timeline and the list of tasks you already have because you may not have enough time for a new assignment in the close future either.
